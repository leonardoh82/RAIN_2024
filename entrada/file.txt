Based on historical behaviors, sequential recommendation endeavors to predict what a user
prefers next. The recent efforts are mainly devoted to modeling the user’s interests evolution
process or mining multi-interests for recommendation. However, it is largely overlooked that
the interest trend (i.e., the evolution of the main interest) and the interest diversity (i.e., the
scattered potential interests) could complement each other for better performance.
Specifically, the interest trend reveals the user’s basic interest and its evolution, which is
satisfied by similarity recommendations. Nevertheless, interest diversity covers the various
interests caused by some external environmental influence, e.g., fashion trends and
advertisements, exploring users’ potential interests or interest diversity will facilitate the
model for diversity and serendipity recommendation. In a way, these two factors have
conflicting aims, we argue that they should be disentangled in modeling first and recombined
when making personalized recommendation.
